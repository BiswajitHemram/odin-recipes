                <li>2 bunches spinach, washed and blanched</li>
                <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons ginger-garlic paste</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon cumin powder</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon coriander powder</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
                <li>1/2 teaspoon garam masala</li>
                <li>1/4 cup heavy cream</li>
                <li>Salt to taste</li>
                <li>Ghee or oil for cooking</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Blanch the spinach leaves: Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add the spinach leaves and blanch them for 2-3 minutes until wilted. Drain and immediately transfer the spinach to a bowl of cold water to retain the green color. Drain again and blend the blanched spinach into a smooth puree. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Heat oil or ghee in a pan over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and let them splutter.</li>
                <li>Add finely chopped onions and sauté until they turn golden brown.</li>
                <li>Add ginger-garlic paste and green chilies. Sauté for a minute until the raw smell disappears.</li>
                <li>Add chopped tomatoes and cook until they become soft and mushy.</li>
                <li>Add turmeric powder, red chili powder, and garam masala. Mix well and cook for a minute to release the flavors.</li>
                <li>Add the spinach puree to the pan and mix everything together. Cook for a few minutes until the spinach is well incorporated with the spices.</li>
                <li>Add salt to taste and mix well.</li>
                <li>Gently add the paneer cubes to the spinach gravy. Mix gently to coat the paneer with the gravy.</li>
                <li>Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 5-7 minutes, allowing the flavors to blend together.</li>
                <li>Stir in the heavy cream and cook for another 2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove from heat and transfer the Palak Paneer to a serving dish.</li>
            </ol>
